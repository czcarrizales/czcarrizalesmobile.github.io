                                <p>Jason Voorhees was born in the small town of Crystal Lake on June 13, 1946 to Elias
                                    Voorhees and Pamela Voorhees. Though his age is often disputed, as the actress for
                                    Pamela created a backstory for her character that put Jason's birthdate in 1944.
                                    Jason was afflicted with severe facial deformities, Hydrocephalus, an abnormally
                                    large head, and mental disabilities. Raising Jason on her own, Pamela kept her son
                                    isolated from the community, not letting him attend school and educating him in
                                    their home on the outskirts of Crystal Lake. Due to his mental deficiencies, his
                                    education was quite limited, but he learned never to question his mother. He obeyed
                                    all his mothers orders, grasping the concept that his life was going to be
                                    difficult, if not impossible, without her guidance. His extreme obedience for his
                                    mother would manifest itself in a strange way after puberty. Even after she died,
                                    Jason could imagine her talking to him from beyond the grave.</p>

                                    Superhuman Strength: In Part 2, Jason was shown to have some sort of enhanced
                                    strength capable of impaling victims with ease and was capable of breaking out a
                                    window with a single shot and his fist was barely formed and within Part III was
                                    capable of crushing someone's head while lifting them and later throwing said 100+
                                    pound man through a window, and finally in Part IV he was able to twist a man's head
                                    around along with a hacksaw, crushing a teenager's skull against a wall, being able
                                    to break through a window and throw girl out of said window with ease, and was able
                                    to smash through a door completely demolishing it. Thus making it his default
                                    strength, for when he was alive as he was rarely overpowered by normal individuals.
