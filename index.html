        <h3>Michael Myers</h3>
        <p>Michael Myers is a fictional character from the Halloween series of slasher films. He first appears in 1978
          in John Carpenter's Halloween as a young boy who murders his elder sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later,
          he returns home to Haddonfield to murder more teenagers. In the original Halloween, the adult Michael Myers,
          referred to as The Shape in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Castle for most of the film and
          substituted by Tony Moran and Tommy Lee Wallace in the final scenes. The character was created by John
          Carpenter and has appeared in ten films, as well as novels, multiple video games, and several comic books.</p>

        <h3>1428 Elm Street</h3>
        <p>1428 Elm Street, also known as [the] Elm Street House, is a fictional residential house and street address in
          Springwood, Ohio, and is an important location in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, where it has been
          the home of Nancy Thompson and her mother, later Jesse Walsh and his family, and finally Lori Campbell and her
          father throughout the film series. It has also been hinted at to have been Freddy Krueger's home when he was
          alive. It further appears in some form in nearly all the films, as well as literature, comics, video games and
          music videos. The house, like Nancy, Tina Gray, Kristen Parker as well as their mutual tormentor and eventual
          murderer Freddy Krueger, were all conceived by the late horror legend Wes Craven.</p>

        <h3>Lament Configuration</h3>
        <p>The Lament Configuration is a fictional lock puzzle or puzzle box appearing in horror stories by Clive
          Barker, or in works based on his original stories. The best known of these boxes is Lemarchand's Box, which
          features prominently throughout the Hellraiser movie series. This was designed and made by Simon Sayce, one of
          the original creative team. A Lemarchand's box is a mystical/mechanical device that acts as a door — or a key
          to a door — to another dimension or plane of existence. The solution of the puzzle creates a bridge through
          which beings may travel in either direction across this "Schism". The inhabitants of these other realms may
          seem demonic to humans. An ongoing debate in the film series is whether the realm accessed by the Lament
          Configuration is intended to be the Christian version of Hell, or some other dimension of endless pain and
          suffering.</p>
